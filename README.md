PyStyl
======

PyStyl is Python package for stylometry or the quantitative analysis of writing style. PyStyl aims to be usable in three ways:
* as a Python API (for Python programmers)
* as a standalone command line tool (for technical users who don't write Python)
* via a Graphical User Interface that runs in the browser (for non-technical users)

PyStyl is pronounced 'pistol', because it is as fast as a gun - or at least, that is the goal.


Installation
------
PyStyl is still in its earliest stages of development, but if you would like to play around with it, clone the repository and run:

```python
python setup.py install
```

While there are a few other dependencies, installing Anaconda should get you a long way. Most things currently work under Python 2.7+ and Python 3.
